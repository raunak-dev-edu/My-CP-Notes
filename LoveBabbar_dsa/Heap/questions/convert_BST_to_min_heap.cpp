Store the inorder traversal of the BST in array and then do preorder traversal of the BST and while doing preorder traversal copy the values of inorder traversal into the current node, as copying the sorted elements while doing preorder traversal will make sure that a Min-Heap is constructed with the condition that all the values in the left subtree of a node are less than all the values in the right subtree of the node.

Follow the given steps to solve the problem:

Create an array arr[] of size N, where N is the number of nodes in the given BST.
Perform the inorder traversal of the BST and copy the node values in the arr[] in sorted order.
Now perform the preorder traversal of the tree.
While traversing the root during the preorder traversal, one by one copy the values from the array arr[] to the nodes of the BST.
